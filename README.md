# Final Year Project

### About

This project represents the culmination of all the programming work I have completed throughout my (ongoing) final year at university.

It is an extension of my 3DGP assignment from second year, and is expected to undergo changes and transformations in the upcoming months as more additions and modifications are implemented.

### Instructions

#### Ubuntu / Debian:

The SDL2 and GLEW development packages are necessary for this project. If they are not already installed on your system, you may need to install them:

```sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libglew-dev```

#### GUIWindows:

I have not yet tested building for GUIWindows. SDL2 and GLEW are already included in the project's "external" folder and linked through CMakeLists.txt, but you may need to do additional setup. 

If you are able to successfully build for GUIWindows, please let me know so that I can officially add build support for this platform.
